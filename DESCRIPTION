Description: Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
    difference ('RD') or rate ratio (or relative risk, 'RR') for 
    binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio 
    ('OR', binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single 
    binomial or Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs. 
    Includes skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods, 
    which have been developed in Laud (2017) <doi:10.1002/pst.1813>
    from Miettinen & Nurminen (1985) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211> and 
    Gart & Nam (1988) <doi:10.2307/2531848>. The same score produces 
    hypothesis tests analogous to the test for binomial RD and RR by 
    Farrington & Manning (1990) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780091208>, or the
    McNemar test for paired data. 
    The package also includes MOVER methods
    (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery) for all contrasts, derived 
    from the Newcombe method but with options to use equal-tailed 
    intervals in place of the Wilson score method,
    and generalised for Bayesian applications incorporating prior 
    information. So-called 'exact' methods for strictly conservative 
    coverage are approximated using continuity corrections, and the amount
    of correction can be selected to avoid over-conservative coverage.
    Also includes methods for stratified calculations (e.g. meta-analysis),
    either assuming fixed effects (matching the CMH test) or incorporating 
    stratum heterogeneity.
